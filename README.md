# Driver Drowsiness Detection
This project uses Python libraries and is here to help keep drivers safe on the road by monitoring signs of drowsiness in real-time. Using a camera feed, it keeps an eye on the driver’s eye movements, and if it detects signs of prolonged eye closure, it sounds an alarm to help keep the driver alert. With a simple and easy-to-use interface, you can start, stop, and adjust settings effortlessly.
## Features
1. Real-Time Eye Monitoring: Tracks the driver’s eye movements to look for signs of drowsiness.
2. Instant Audio Alert: Plays a sound if it detects prolonged eye closure, alerting the driver to wake up.
3. Customizable Sensitivity: Adjust the drowsiness sensitivity by setting your own eye closure threshold.
4. Start/Stop Control: Simple buttons to start or stop monitoring as needed.
